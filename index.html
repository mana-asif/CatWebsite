                        Lots of different types of animals exist in the world.
                        You might run into them if you go outside. However, I do not 
                        recommend going outside because that is also where the people are. 
                        Humans are the only animals that would be able to read this website.
                        Or rather, human beings are the only intelligent life form that we are
                        aware of. There has been much speculation as to whether or not other 
                        intelligent beings exist on other planets, however as of yet, none have
                        been discovered.
